Statistical and Machine Learning techniques allows us to better understand and extract information from 
complex systems in multiple areas, such as Neuroscience, Smart Cities, and High-Performance Computing. 
One can then improve and interact these systems, by extracting information from brain EEG signals, 
providing evidence for public policies in smart cities, and improving computing resource usages in 
computer systems.        

I have expertise in interdisciplinary research in the fields of Neuroscience, Smart Cities, and 
High-Performance Computing. I interact with researchers of those areas to apply machine 
learning techniques to solve problems and improve the scientific understanding.
