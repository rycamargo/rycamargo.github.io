# Research Interests

My current research area is on the application of Machine Learning methods in areas such as
Smart Cities, Neuroscience, and High-Performance computing.

**SMART CITIES**

- Health Data



- Mobility 

Public bus systems are an essential part of urban mobility, due to their low cost and high capillarity. But providing acceptable for users is difficult due to limited system capacity, interactions with the city traffic, and disruptions caused by city events. We analyze GPS from public buses from SÃ£o Paulo city to better understand the factors that impact the reliability of bus systems, to determine disruptions in the bus systems in real-time, and to predict the future states of the bus systems.

**MACHINE LEARNING**

- Self-Supervised Learning of EEG Data using Neural Networks

EEG signals are generated from the collective activity of billions of neurons and allow us to monitor brain function using non-invasive electrodes. The captured signals are noisy and contain overlapped signals from many regions, making them difficult to interpret. We use self-supervised learning in neural networks to learn representations of EEG signals, allowing the detection of changes in neural processing when performing tasks in psychophysical experiments.    



**HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPUTING**

- Learning better HPC Scheduling Policies

Existing supercomputers must process many thousands of jobs (programs) submitted by users. Defining how to prioritize the execution is the main task of job resource managers. We use machine learning techniques to improve this scheduling process by: (1) generating custom policies for specific architectures and workloads, and (2) selecting the best policy to apply to each machine given its current state.





**PREVIOUS RESEARCH TOPICS**


- Accelerating Biology and Neuroscience applications using GPUs

Many biological and neuroscience applications require very large amounts of computational power and can benefit from the massively parallel processing units available on GPUs. We developed algorithms in CUDA for simulations Hodgkin-Huxley networks, determination of gene regulatory networks and enumerating hitting set solutions. 


- Functional Connectivity in Neural Networks

The brain is composed of thousands of brain regions that must communicate in an organized way. Directed Functional Connectivity can be estimated using causality methods, such as Granger Causality and Partial Directed Coherence. We use computational models of mice connectomes to evaluate the applicability of these measurements in neural signals.
