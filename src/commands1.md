# About Me

My current main research areas are in *High-Performance Computing*, **Machine Learning**, and 
***Computational Neuroscience***. I work mostly at the intersection of the above areas, bridging the gap among them.

Our `def mega_chain` function works really well:

    def mega_chain(): return

```{code-block} python3
:linenos:
:emphasize-lines: 2
def mega_chain(): 
    return
```

```{literalinclude} conf.py
:emphasize-lines: 2-3
```
Investors say the best things about us:

> I'm so glad I put my life savings in Schlockchain.
> > Said Nobody Ever

We have a patented algorithm:
- Glacially slow
- Which melts glaciers

...and a roadmap to success:

1. Start an LLC
2. Get a Series A investment round
